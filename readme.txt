Inserts blog comments from non-logged-in users into the activity stream

== Description ==

By default, BuddyPress does not include comments from non-members (or non-logged-in users more generally) in the sitewide activity stream. This plugin records activity items for those comments.

== Installation ==

*Upload the directory '/bp-include-non-member-comments/' to your WP plugins directory and activate from the Dashboard of the main blog.
*If you're using a version of BP prior to 1.2, you'll need to uncomment lines 13 and 14 of the plugin in order to activate it.
